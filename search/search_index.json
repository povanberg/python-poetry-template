For more information, please refer to Github documentation. <code>assets</code> Optional Assets are used to store additional files that are used within your project.  e.g. configuration files, images, etc. <code>dockers</code> Required This template is designed with support for multi-containers applications. For this reason, the conventional root <code>dockerfile</code> is moved within a hierarichal structure. Such hierarchical pattern allow, the application to preserve consistency through docker composition paths. e.g. <code> dockers/dev/dockerfile</code><code>dockers/webapp/dockerfile</code> <code>docs</code> Optional The docs directory contains everything related to the documentation of your project. It contains the documention styles, assets and pages which will be orchestrated by the <code>mkdocs.yml</code> configuration. <code>lib</code> Optional Some projects require external library to be imported. While it is usually a bad practice, to directly include library sources in your project, some specific use cases require to directly embedes the library within the codebase. <code>notebooks</code> Optional The notebooks directory contains all the Jupyter notebooks that are used to develop your project. <code>scripts</code> Optional The scripts directory contains all the scripts that are used to develop your project. <code>src</code> Required The src directory contains all the source code of your project. The source super structure, while note being mandatory, offers a clear separation between the source code and the rest of the project. <code>tests</code> Required The tests directory contains all the tests of your project and should follow the same hierachical structure than the <code>src</code> directory."},{"location":"workflows/","title":"Workflows","text":""},{"location":"workflows/#workflows","title":"Workflows","text":"<p> This template is designed to be used with Github Actions.
